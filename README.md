# Boids

Repository Goals:
1. Learn about and implement and emergent system
2. Work on efficient implementation (1)
3. Train RL Agent and GAN to "blend in" with a Flock of boids.

Based on https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html

https://processing.org/download is needed to run the processing portion.  Otherwise, it is also being translated into Python.
